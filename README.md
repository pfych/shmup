# Shmup

This is my first C++ project ever, using it to learn the language as well as a few libraries:

- [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

You can build with the following command:

```shell
cmake --build ./cmake-build-debug --target shmup__ -j 14
./cmake-build-debug/bin/shmup__
```

There's lots of `@todo` tags in this repo - all things I either want to change or things I want to understand more.
